<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After 20 years of experience in Financial Planning, I've made the exciting decision to shift gears and build on my skill set to become a web developer. My background has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of how to navigate complex systems—skills I’m eager to apply to the world of technology and development.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I place a strong emphasis on quality family time. Balancing work and personal life is important to me, and I make it a priority to be present for my loved ones. On weekends, you can often find me at the beach, soaking up the sun, or catching up with friends and family. I truly value these moments of connection and relaxation.</p>

<p>I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and the journey of growing in this new field, while staying grounded in what matters most—family, connection, and continuous learning.</p>
